<p>Getting to grips with betting actions is essential to playing poker games well. The main betting choices offered in most poker variations are summarised as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Betting Option</th>
<th>Usage</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Check</td>
<td>If there isn&rsquo;t a bet in the current betting round, we can use this option to move the action to our left without placing a wager.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bet</td>
<td>We placed the first wager in this round of betting, compelling other players to either match it or fold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fold</td>
<td>We refuse to match the bet that is currently in play. Resigning from the pot and forfeiting any claim to it is known as folding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Call</td>
<td>If there is an existing wager in the current betting round, &ldquo;calling&rdquo; means precisely matching that stake to remain in the hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Raise</td>
<td>We have the option of raising any wager that is already in place during the current betting round. The first bettor is then required to fold or match our raise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Re-raise</td>
<td>We have the option of raising again if a player has already raised on the current street. &ldquo;Re-raises,&rdquo; with names like &ldquo;3-bets,&rdquo; &ldquo;4-bets,&rdquo; and so on, are raises that come after the initial one.</td>
